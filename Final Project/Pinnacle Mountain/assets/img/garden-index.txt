          <p itemprop="description" class="p1">
            Pinnacle Mountain State Park is located in central Arkansas near the northeast corner of the Ouachita Mountains. The parkâ€™s namesake is the first prominent
             cone-shaped mountain encountered by early westward travelers as they emerged from the alluvial plains of east Arkansas. Its cone-like appearance has long beckoned
             travelers and residents alike to ascend its peak for breathtaking views of the surrounding hills and valleys.</p>
          <p class="p2">
            It is a day-use park dedicated to environmental education, recreation, and preservation. Located just west of Little Rock, this natural environment was set
             aside in 1977 as Arkansas's first state park adjoining a major metropolitan area. Operating as a day-use only park, Pinnacle Mountain is dedicated to preservation,
              recreation, and environmental education. Park interpreters and volunteers help visitors and students understand man's relationship to the environment in the 2,000-acre park that offers a rich diversity of natural habitat.</p>
          
          <p class="p3">
                The park's dominant natural feature, Pinnacle Mountain, rises more than a thousand feet above the Arkansas River Valley. The mountain's cone-shaped peak has long been
                 a central Arkansas landmark. Two of the park's hiking trails lead hikers to the mountain's summit.</p>
                 
                 
          <p class="p4">
            Park facilities include picnic sites, two standard pavilions with restrooms, launch ramps, and hiking trails. The park visitor center overlooking the Arkansas
             River includes exhibits, A/V programs, a meeting room, and gift shop.</p>

          <p class="p5">
             Within the park's environs is the Arkansas Arboretum, a 71-acre site exhibiting native flora representing Arkansas's six, major natural divisions. Below Pinnacle Mountain along the Little Maumelle River, the arboretum
             includes a .6-mile barrier-free, interpretive trail.</p>


        <p class="p6">
                Camping is not available at Pinnacle Mountain State Park.
                Park gates at Pinnacle Mountain State Park are closed one hour after sunset.</p>
